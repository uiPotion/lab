In a world filled with AI chatbots, why build another one? It's a fair question, and one we asked ourselves repeatedly during development.

## The Problem with Current Solutions

Most AI chat interfaces fall into two categories:
1. **Overly complex** enterprise tools that require weeks of setup
2. **Too simple** consumer apps that lack customization

We wanted something in the middle—powerful yet approachable, customizable yet simple.

## Our Philosophy

### Beautiful by Default

Great design shouldn't be an afterthought. Every interaction should feel polished and intentional.

### Developer-Friendly

We believe the best tools are built *with* developers, not *for* them. That's why we made PotionKit fully customizable and open about how it works.

### Privacy-First

Your data belongs to you. No training on your conversations, no selling your data, no tracking beyond what's essential.

## Technical Decisions

We chose **Handlebars** for templating because it's simple and powerful. We built on **HaroldJS** for static site generation because it's fast and flexible.

The result is a chatbot platform that feels modern without being overwhelming—exactly what we wanted.
