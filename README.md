# uipotion-lab

A lab and playground for web experiments AI generated based on [UIPotion](https://uipotion.com).

Each subdirectory is a standalone experiment with its own stack and setup.

## Important Note

These projects are experiments and starting points, not production-ready templates. If you want to use any of this code in a real project, you are welcome to do so, but plan to review, harden, and extend it based on your own requirements. You can also keep vibe-coding from these experiments using tools like `potion-kit` or Cursor with UIPotion specs.

## Experiments

- **[experiment-1](./experiment-1/)** — Dark-mode landing page, auth flow, and data dashboard. Generate with [potion-kit](https://github.com/uiPotion/potion-kit) and Kimi K2.5 model.
- **[experiment-2](./experiment-2/)** — Dark/light mode blog experience with article pages, category browsing, contact form, and client-side search using Lunr. Generate with [potion-kit](https://github.com/uiPotion/potion-kit) and Kimi K2.5 model.

## Prerequisites

Requirements vary by experiment. Typically Node.js and npm; see each experiment’s README for details.
